### Inspiration:
The inspiration behind SpaceOrbiters comes from a deep-rooted fascination with the cosmos and a desire to make space exploration more accessible and engaging in todays era. Recognizing the vast potential of technology in revolutionizing our understanding of the universe, we aimed to create a fully dynamic and comprehensive platform that not only serves as an educational resource but also a community hub for space enthusiasts and technophiles.

### What it does:
Space Orbiters is an innovative platform that brings the universe to users' fingertips.The key features include:

Community Chat: A MERN stack-based chat application for like-minded space enthusiasts to connect and share ideas.

Virtual panoramic 360 degree Visualization: Providing an immersive experience of space images using panorama 360 degree view of an image, with future goals to incorporate AR/VR technology.

Solar System Simulation: Individuals can explore the solarsystem and can relate the actual time velocity relation, virtual satellite  launch setup, galatic mode.

Heliocentric System: One can easily able to get all the information, facts, events on a single click to planets also individual can open and enter to the dedicated Planet chat.

Picture of the Day: Showcasing daily images from NASA, inspiring users with the beauty of space.

Custom GPT: Utilizing GPT-4, this AI answers space-related queries, enhancing the educational aspect of the platform.

Historical Events Timeline: A slider feature showing significant events in space exploration history.

Celestial Bodies Database: Detailed insights into various celestial bodies and their characteristics.

Image Gallery: A collection of awe-inspiring space images from NASA's API.

### How we built it:
SpaceOrbiters was built using a blend of modern technologies and APIs. The MERN stack (Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Three.js) forms the backbone of our web application, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience. Integration with NASA's APIs allows us to fetch real-time, high-quality space data. The custom GPT, built using GPTBuilder and GPT-4, adds a unique interactive and informative dimension to the platform.

### Challenges we ran into:
1.Finding and integrating correct and up-to-date API's.
2.Developing a custom GPT model to accurately respond to space-related queries.
3.Creating an engaging and user-friendly interface that accommodates a diverse range of features.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of:
1.Successfully integrating NASA's API to provide dynamic space content.
2.Building a robust chat application that fosters community engagement.
3.Developing a custom GPT model tailored for space-related inquiries.
4.Creating a timeline feature that makes learning about space history interactive and engaging.

Compatibility: The web application of SpaceOrbiters is tested on windows till yet.

### What's next for SpaceOrbiters:
1.Machine Learning: Utilizing ML algorithms for predictive analysis and pattern recognition in space research.

2.AR/VR Integration: Introducing augmented and virtual reality features to provide an immersive educational experience in space exploration.

3.Community Growth and Engagement: Further developing community features to foster collaboration and learning among space enthusiasts.
